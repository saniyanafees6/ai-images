# Tensorflow based AI Web Application 

## Image Classifier

This is my first AI web application, It's a simple Image Classifier that uses Tensorflow's pretrained Object Detection model called coco-ssd. The Live Web App can be checked out [here](https://saniyanafees6.github.io/ai-images/index.html).

Since I used CDNs in my application you wouldn't need to download any dependancies to get started.
